# LoanDefaulters
A finance company provides customers with housing loans at reasonable and economical 
interest rates. It suffered a lot due to loan defaults. The majority of the applicants are not 
repaying their loans in accordance with the promissory note. 
The potential of your project to contribute to your problem domain. 
So, we started a new system that identifies loan defaulters based on the data. This system will  
assist in identifying potential applicants and ensuring a smooth process. We are planning to  
build a new system to predict the probability of an applicant defaulting on a loan or not in the  
future. 
Why is this contribution crucial? 
It is very important to build a system that helps to identify the potential applicants who are not  
paying the loans otherwise the company will incur huge losses.

I have used linear regression, logistic regression, na√Øve bayes classifier and support vector machine in 
phase 2. The regression models have not been much efficient for classification and in the rest of the models 
Decision tree has highest accuracy. 
Decision tree classification has performed better for loan defaulters prediction compared to other machine 
learning models linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machine, and Naive Bayes classifier 
because Loan default prediction has non-linear relationships between features and target variable which 
better captures using decision trees. Linear and logistic regressions may not be able to capture the 
interactions between different features efficiently. Decision trees are robust to outliers in the data and are 
easy to interpret.
